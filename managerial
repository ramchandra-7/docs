Managerial round: 
 

Tell me about yourself and role: 

 

Thank you for the opportunity 

 
Hello, I'm Rmachandra.  

I bring over five years of experience as a Hadoop Administrator.  

In my role, I specialize in creating clusters, including data hubs, data warehouses, CML, and CDE, 

tailored to meet user requirements. My responsibilities extend to troubleshooting any challenges faced by users during their tasks, 

such as resource and authentication issues. I meticulously document each issue and 

proactively build custom Docker images based on user specifications. 

  

Collaborating closely with clients, I provide effective solutions to address their concerns. 

Additionally, I actively engage in resolving P1 tickets to minimize downtime, ensuring seamless operations. 

Beyond my professional expertise,  

I am passionate about cricket and fitness, holding a professional cricket player status and identifying as a gym enthusiast. 

  

Within our support portfolio, I contribute to applications like Nabu and Tellic. 

I hold certifications as an AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate (SAA) and a Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA).  

Furthermore, I play a pivotal role in maintaining the latest versions of CDP tools and conduct upgrades as needed to optimize 

system performance. 

 

 

how will you contribute to team? 

  

by being positive,by getting to know my co-workers , by understanding what i can  do to help team acheive its objectives based on my strengths 	by analyzing what i can do better to support other team. 

  

i see it as my responsibility to fit into the team , to be flexible and to do all i cna to add value to what they are alreday acheiving. 

  

how do you prioritize tasks at work? 

by carefully payinga attention and listening to my manager's brief , by deciding what tasks are more most important in relation to team's objectives and by determining the time scale for each task to be completed  

  

  

for example in my role i would get a lot of tickets from customers 

first i would respond and udpate those tickets and then work on the taks that are urgent or require any definitive time frame for completion , then i would go to the less important onesz 

  

biggest strengths and weakness 

one of the biggest strenth which will be beneficial to this role is am a quick leaners and need very little supervision and monitoring 

i cna be relied upon to do everything on right standard and on time 

iam somebody that takes responsibilty and embrace change positively 

  

wekaness would be overthinking, i struggle to ask people for help if ever i feel difficult to complete a task. i prfer to complete it alone when i should be asking for help 

am trying to imporve in these type of situtaions and iam someone who always seek to imporve and develop 

  

  

ideal work environment? 

 									 

the one which is positive, busy and supprotive 

  

perfer to work in a diverse work environment where there is lot of skill and experience because you can learn from other people in the team 

  

  

react to any mistake that you make? 

  

we all mistakes from time to time. 

first and foremost be honest about the mistake 

take ownership, learn from it, correct it and move on 

  

not dwell on it, inform my manager if required and explain why it happend so i could improve form my next time 

  

handle conflicts with co-workers 

try to avoid because i believe it is not helpful for the team. 

  

however, if it did occur, 

be mature and adopt a professional approach , see if i were contributing to conflict in any way . talk to other person and undertand from their perspextive and agree on a way weher we both are comfortable with it 

  

compromise and find a way thats in best intersts of the team

Where do you see yourself in 5 yrs? 

Not a guy who worries too much about the future.i like to stay in the present and keep learning new skills. Iam a huge fan of msdhoni both on field and off-field. He once said ,concentrate on the process and the results will follow. If you still shoot the same question at me , i would say learn new technologies , lead a larger bunch of team , take more responsibilitties and be at a higher role at the company 

 

  

  

  

What motivates you at work? 

  

I am motivated by the desire to help guide all of my team members to success. For example, I remember when I was helping one of my team members complete a new task.

They ended up receiving praise for this task and it fulfilled me knowing I helped them accomplish success. 

  

  

Why are you interested in leaving your current job? 

 

One reason would be platform has become stable now.so, work has become stagnant. Even if we face issues, its most likely one we have faced already. So , no new challenges. I am a guy who like to work on new challenges.  

Am techincally strong in the tools used by cloudera
